# ML_Master_AUT
This semester I've taken ML master course in AUT and to be honest it has had almost nothing to teach me :))). Well, our
education system is too slow. People in college build models and deploy them, and we want to teach our master students
what a decision tree is :)). If you are a CE student at AUT simply and you know classical machine learning just don't take 
this course.
